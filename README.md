# Website-Traffic-Forecasting-


This project focuses on forecasting website page loads using time series and machine learning models. It analyzes 7 years of historical data to detect trends, seasonality, and patterns in user traffic.

## 📊 Technologies Used
- Python, Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Statsmodels
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Power BI (for final visualization)
- Excel (for initial analysis)

## 🔍 Key Steps
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Stationarity checks using ADF test
- Forecasting using ARIMA, SARIMA, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting
- Model Evaluation (RMSE, MAPE)
- Visualization of actual vs forecasted results

## 📁 Project Structure
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for model training & preprocessing
- `data/`: Sample or source-linked dataset
- `visuals/`: Output charts and graphs
- `presentation/`: Final project presentation

## 📈 Outcome
Built multiple models and identified the best-performing one for traffic forecasting. Improved understanding of user behavior and provided insights for future content and server planning.
